    "# Customer Behavior and Sales Trends Analysis Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, youâ€™ll analyse and visualize data from a UK-based e-commerce platform, focusing on customer purchasing behaviors and sales patterns. Follow each step carefully to create Python functions that reveal insights into customer behavior and product sales trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Information\n",
    "This dataset contains transaction records from a UK e-commerce store over one year, with customers predominantly being wholesale buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**:\n",
    "- Use this dataset [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) (Online Retail dataset). Download it as an Excel file and rename it as `Customer_Behavior.xlsx` .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Download and place the dataset in the same directory as your Python code file.\n",
    "2. Create a Python file named `behavior_trends_analysis.py` containing the required functions described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **import_data(filename: str) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Import the dataset from an Excel or CSV file into a DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `filename`: The name of the dataset file (string).\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A Pandas DataFrame with the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Notes**: Ensure that this function can read both Excel and CSV formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **filter_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Filter the data by removing rows with any missing `CustomerID` and excluding rows with negative values in either `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `df`: The raw DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A filtered DataFrame with complete and positive records only.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **loyalty_customers(df: pd.DataFrame, min_purchases: int) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Identify loyal customers based on a minimum purchase threshold.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `df`: The cleaned DataFrame.\n",
    "     - `min_purchases`: Minimum number of purchases required to qualify as a loyal customer.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A DataFrame listing customers who have made at least `min_purchases` transactions, including the count of their purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **quarterly_revenue(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Calculate the total revenue per quarter.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `df`: The cleaned DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A DataFrame with two columns: `quarter` and `total_revenue`, representing the total revenue generated in each quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **high_demand_products(df: pd.DataFrame, top_n: int) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Identify the `top_n` products with the highest total quantity sold across all transactions.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `df`: The cleaned DataFrame.\n",
    "     - `top_n`: Number of top products to return.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A DataFrame listing the `top_n` most demanded products based on total quantity sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **purchase_patterns(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Create a summary showing the average quantity and average unit price for each product.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `df`: The cleaned DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A DataFrame with three columns: `product`, `avg_quantity`, and `avg_unit_price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Questions (Multiple Choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is it important to filter data to remove rows with missing or negative values?\n",
    "   - **A)** Negative or missing values could represent data entry errors, which affect calculations.\n",
    "   - **B)** Removing them reduces the size of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **C)** Negative values can bias time-series analyses.\n",
    "   - **D)** These values can indicate customer returns, which need separate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What insight can quarterly revenue provide to business analysts?\n",
    "   - **A)** It enables comparison of average revenue per month.\n",
    "   - **B)** Quarterly aggregation helps reveal seasonal trends.\n",
    "   - **C)** It simplifies monthly expense tracking.\n",
    "   - **D)** Quarterly data provides product-specific insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why is identifying loyal customers valuable in customer segmentation?\n",
    "   - **A)** Loyal customers often make high-volume purchases.\n",
    "   - **B)** Loyal customers respond better to sales promotions.\n",
    "   - **C)** Loyal customers are easier to retain and less likely to churn.\n",
    "   - **D)** Loyal customers prefer seasonal product offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why might it be valuable to analyse average quantity and unit price by product?\n",
    "   - **A)** To optimize pricing strategies based on demand.\n",
    "   - **B)** To predict future stock needs for each product.\n",
    "   - **C)** To estimate the profit margin per product.\n",
    "   - **D)** To determine ideal product pairings for promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which of the following is most useful for evaluating product demand trends?\n",
    "   - **A)** Counting the total quantity sold of each product.\n",
    "   - **B)** Tracking the purchase frequency per customer.\n",
    "   - **C)** Analysing the total revenue per customer.\n",
    "   - **D)** Calculating the average quantity purchased per transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **def answer_conceptual_questions() -> dict:**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Implement a function named `answer_conceptual_questions` that returns a dictionary with your answers to the multiple-choice questions.\n",
    "   - **Output**: The function should return a dictionary where each key is a question number (e.g., \"Q1\", \"Q2\") and each value is a set of answer choices (e.g., `{\"A\"}`, `{\"A\", \"C\"}`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "- Implement all functions in `behavior_trends_analysis.py`.\n",
    "- After the submission deadline, I will provide a pytest grading script and the solution, allowing you to review your work and understand the grading criteria.\n"
